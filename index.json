Further, the following parameters are needed: TaxonomyHiddenListId: can be found by adding \"/Lists/TaxonomyHiddenList\" to the site url RemovedTermSetId: the TaxonomyHiddenList contains a field with an ID reference to the term set. By looking for a term in the deleted term set, you can find the ID. RemovedTermSetName: name of the term set that has been removed. RemovedTermSetGroupName: term group name where the term set was stored. SiteUrl: site where the terms are used. This script is not ready to be used for multiple sites because if a child term doesn't have a parent yet in the term set, it will create that term with the correct label but not the correct ID. However, the first part can be modified to group all the data of different sites. Description When running the script, the following steps are executed: Creating a connection with SharePoint. This shows a pop-up the first time. Get all the terms from the TaxonomyHiddenList. Create the missing term set if needed. If the term set exists, the script continues. Adding all root terms that are used directly or that have a child term that is used. Adding all child terms by depth incremental. This step also adds parent terms (with a random ID) that were not used in order to restore the tree structure.

There are two options to submit: Using a Pull Request (technical) Using a GitHub Issue Submitting a Pull Request The first step when submitting a new script, is to pull the code to your local machine (git clone https://github.com/dlw-digitalworkplace/dw-script-lib.git). Create a new branch that starts from the main branch and use the following naming convention: submission/[name-of-script] Create a new folder in the PowerShell or ConsoleApps folder (depending on what you are submitting). Give the folder a clear name (e.g. Add-UserToGroup, Update-SharePointListColumn, ...) Copy the content Example.md file from the /Templates to your new folder. (The templates folder contains an example structure of how your scripts folder should look like) Add the PowerShell script or Console app code to the same folder. Make sure the PS filename is the same as the .md file Update the .md file with all the needed details Update the toc.yml file in the PowerShell or ConsoleApps folder and include your new script. Navigate to GitHub and create a new pull request into the main branch. Select either the 'New PowerShell Script' or 'New Console Application' template and fill in all the details Wait for approval 🎉 Creating a GitHub Issue Navigate to the GitHub repo Go to \"Issues\" and create a new one Select the 'Script Submission Request' template Fill in all the template details.
